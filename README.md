# LungsCancerPrediction_Probability-Statistics_Project
Our Lung Cancer Prediction Project, conducted by a dedicated team of five individuals, explores the application of Probability and Statistics in predicting the likelihood of lung cancer.


Problem Statement
We will analyze lung cancer, a prevalent cancer type, using this dataset to understand how various environmental and lifestyle factors affect individuals of different ages. With a focus on 21 factors, including air pollution, alcohol use, dust allergy, smoking, and dry cough, our goal is to identify the level of impact each factor has on lung cancer severity.
Objective
Our main goal is to utilize statistical tools on this dataset to explore the relationships between various factors and their impact on lung cancer patients, specifically focusing on the severity of the disease. The following tools have been used to quantify specific relations:
•	Histograms
•	Bar charts
•	Pie charts
•	Box plots
•	Scatter plots
And for analysis of this data set we have used:
•	Basic descriptive statistics like (mean, count and standard deviation).
•	Probability distribution (Binomial distribution) because for all the data, value of (n) was less than 100.
•	Logistic regression because it is most helpful in determining disease like datasets.
Data Description
This dataset, titled 'Lung Cancer Prediction,' is sourced from Kaggle and provides a detailed analysis of lung cancer patients. It covers a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors that these patients are exposed to, and correlates them with the severity of their cancer, which is categorized as 'Level' in the dataset. This comprehensive data aims to clarify the impact of various detrimental factors on lung cancer severity. The dataset can be accessed at the following link:

Conclusions
Based on the application of statistical analysis to our dataset, it has been observed that the majority of the subjects are identified as Gender 1, typically representing men. Additionally, factors such as Air Pollution and Alcohol Use demonstrate considerable variability among the patients. Similarly, variables like Dust Allergy, Occupational Hazards, and Genetic Risk also exhibit significant diversity across the dataset. A noteworthy correlation has been identified between Air Pollution and Dust Allergy, exhibiting a moderate positive relationship. This finding suggests a higher likelihood of Dust Allergy in patients exposed to elevated levels of Air Pollution. Furthermore, symptoms including 'Fatigue', 'Weight Loss', and 'Shortness of Breath' display moderate correlation with each other, potentially indicating their prevalent co-occurrence in cancer patients. This analysis provides critical insights into the environmental, genetic, and symptomatic factors associated with cancer, underscoring the importance of these variables in understanding and managing the disease.
